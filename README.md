# Image Classification- a Data Science, Computer Vision and Machine Learning project
## Languages Used:
#### 🐍 Python, 🖥️ HTML, 📱 CSS, 💻 Javascript
## Frameworks Used:
#### 🧊 Numpy, 🐼 Pandas, 📊 Matplotlib, 📶 Seaborn, 📈 Scikit-Learn, 🖼️ OpenCV, 🌶️ Flask
## Tools Used:

## About This Project
#### I developed a web application that combines data science, machine learning, and OpenCV for celebrity image recognition. The application allows users to upload images of various well-known personalities. Utilizing advanced machine learning models and computer vision techniques, the app analyzes the uploaded images and provides a probability score indicating which celebrity the person in the image most closely resembles. It involves the concept of Cascade Classification, Wavelet Transformation, GridSearchCV
#### After all these process, I divided the dataset for Training and Testing the model. I did this for all three model such as Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, SVM and found the best suitable model.
#### I exported my model as a pickle file and I created a website using 🖥️ HTML, 📱 CSS, 💻 Javascript for frontend and 🌶️ Flask server for backend.
## Reach Out:
#### I have added all the files and the model that I have created. I have also included my Jupyter Notebook as a PDF. For any questions, please reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spraveenkumar2205/).
