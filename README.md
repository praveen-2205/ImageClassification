## About This Project
#### In this project I have made a website which finds the probab. It involves the concept of Data Cleaning, Data Visualisation, Outlier Detection, Outlier removal, One Hot Encoding, Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, Grid SearchCV.
#### After all these process, I divided the dataset for Training and Testing the model. I did this for all three model such as Linear Regression, Lasso (L1 Regularisation), Desicion Tree Regressor and found the best suitable model.
#### I exported my model as a pickle file and I created a website using 🖥️ HTML, 📱 CSS, 💻 Javascript for frontend and 🌶️ Flask server for backend.
## Reach Out:
#### I have added all the files and the model that I have created, along with the dataset I downloaded from Kaggle. I have also included my Jupyter Notebook as a PDF. For any questions, please reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spraveenkumar2205/).
